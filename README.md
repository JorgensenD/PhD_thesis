Presented here are code snippets related to my PhD thesis:
"Tools and methods for rapid phylogeographic analysis of pathogen genomic surveillance data with application to poliovirus"

R code to produce and summarise 'local transmission lineages' and plot a map of movements over time from a discrete location labelled phylogeny generated with BEAST is provided in three files:

The correction for discrete trait analysis to account for sampling rate differences by location is presented in:

A beast template for Markov Jump DTA with the proposed correction to account for sampling differences between locations is presented in:
